# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-EDA

This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python Pandas. The project focuses on analyzing Swiggy food Price, Rating, Delivery time and many more things in form of variable from Kaggle, utilizing Jupyter Notebook for coding.

# Overview

The dataset used in this project comprises approximately 8680 entries. The primary objective of the analysis is to perform EDA to gain insights into food price, food item and rating and correlation. 

# Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhijitdahatonde/swiggy-restuarant-dataset

# Python Libraries Used

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Project Details

Data Cleaning: The initial step involves cleaning up the dataset to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Analysis: The focus of the analysis is on Swiggy food order, rating, prices and popularity. Various aspects of the data are explored, including popularity of restaurant, Food items, Rating and Delivery time
Visualization: The insights derived from the data analysis are visually represented using Seaborn and other visualization libraries. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate the findings.
Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of key insights and observations obtained from the EDA process.

# Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for this analysis, simply download the ipynb file and open it in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own analysis projects!

Note: This project is solely for educational and demonstration purposes.
